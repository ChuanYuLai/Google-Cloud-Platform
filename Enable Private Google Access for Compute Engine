## GCP Private Google Access

1. Disable GCE Public IP, reserve internal IP
Enable GCE access scopes for BigQuery

2. The following error will occur If you do not enable GCE access scopes for BigQuery:
```
BigQuery error in ls operation: Insufficient Permission
```

3. Go to VPC networks > Select Region > Enable Private Google Access

4. SSH into GCE testing by using cp
>**Note**:
GCE can't access BigQuery without enable Private Google Access

>**Note**:
BigQuery API cannot be called without modify Compute Engine access scopes 

>**Note**:
To change Compute Engine access scopes, Compute Engine needs to be shut down

5. If you need to deny all egress traffic, you also need to set up Routes and DNS, because all traffic will be sent to 0.0.0.0/0 by default, but if you set up to deny all egress traffic, you need to routing to Private Google Acess ip: 199.36.153.8/30.
